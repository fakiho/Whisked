Add the butter, then rub into the flour using your fingertips to make a light breadcrumb texture. Do not overwork it or the crumble will become heavy. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins or until lightly coloured.\n\nMeanwhile, for the compote, peel, core and cut the apples into 2cm dice. Put the butter and sugar in a medium saucepan and, once the butter is melted, add the apples and cook until slightly softened and golden. Add the blackberries and cinnamon, and cook for 3 mins. Remove from the heat.\n\nTo serve, spoon the warm fruit into an ovenproof gratin dish, top with the crumble mix, then reheat in the oven for 5-10 mins. Serve with custard or ice cream.",

Melt the butter in a small pan, then add the biscuit crumbs and stir until coated with butter. Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling.\n\nCream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. You can do this in a food processor if you have one. Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the eggs, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and process until well combined.\n\nPeel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds.\n\nBake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown and set.\n\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans and push down gently on the sides of the tin. Slide the tart off the base of the tin onto a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, crÃ¨me fraiche or custard.\n\nIf you are making this ahead, store in the fridge and reheat in a low oven (120C/100C Fan/Gas 1/2) for 15-20 minutes to serve warm.",
